  subtitles:
  - (Jumpscare)
  - Time to face the consequences of your failure.
  - Might as well face the facts, you were always destined to fail.
  - You blinked.
  - What is this new prison? Is it me trapped, or is it you? Perhaps it's us both.
  - I may be missing my face, but even I could see this coming.
