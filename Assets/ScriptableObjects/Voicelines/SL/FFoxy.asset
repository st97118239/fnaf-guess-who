  - It seems you couldn't make it to my show, so I brought the show to you!
  - Showtimes are on the hour, not a moment before and not a moment later.
  - I'm sorry, but there was never enough room on this stage for both of us!
  - It's time to take your final bow!
  - A performance was demanded of me, and now I have delivered! Encore!
